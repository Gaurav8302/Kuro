# Changelog

All notable changes to Kuro AI will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-10 - **ONBOARDING & UX ENHANCEMENTS** üöÄ

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-11 - **HOTFIX: Deployment Dependency Resolution** üêõ

### üîß Fixed
- Resolved Render deployment failure caused by incompatible `pymongo==4.13.2` with `motor==3.6.0` (requires `<4.10`). Downgraded to `pymongo==4.9.2` in both `backend/requirements.txt` and `backend/requirements-minimal.txt`.
- Ensured consistency across standard and minimal requirement sets to prevent future resolution divergence.

### üìù Notes
- No code changes; pure dependency alignment. Safe patch release.
- Monitor next deployment to confirm successful environment build.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-11 - **ORCHESTRATION, MEMORY COMPRESSION & OPS** ‚öôÔ∏èüß†

### ‚ú® Added
- **Multi-Model Orchestration Layer**: Capability/intents aware model router with scoring (latency, quality, cost) and graceful fallback chain.
- **Model Registry**: YAML-driven registry (`backend/config/model_registry.yml`) with capabilities, default weights, and fallback configuration.
- **Intent Classification**: Lightweight rule-based classifier (keywords + overrides) powering routing decisions.
- **Circuit Breaker + Resilience**: Automatic open/half-open tracking for failing models; fallback to healthy alternatives.
- **Layered Memory Compression**: Progressive short / medium / long-term summarization with verbatim fact extraction to retain critical details.
- **Context Rehydration**: Smart assembly of prompt context (facts ‚Üí summaries ‚Üí recent turns) under token budget with deterministic trimming.
- **Verbatim Fact Store**: High-signal immutable facts extracted during summarization for accurate persona & knowledge grounding.
- **Token Estimator Utility**: Heuristic token counting for proactive context budgeting and overflow protection.
- **Admin & Introspection Hooks**: Foundations for secured admin endpoints (registry reload, circuit breaker stats, LLM call listing).
- **Observability Scaffolding**: Structured logging (request_id), metrics outlines, Grafana dashboard draft, Sentry hook placeholder.
- **Test Coverage Expansion**: Added tests for intent routing, fallback behavior, memory layering, and context rehydration.
- **CI Workflow**: GitHub Actions pipeline (lint + backend tests + frontend build) for PR validation.

### üîÑ Changed
- **README** expanded to document orchestration & layered memory architecture.
- **Rolling Memory Module** refactored to emit layered summaries + fact blocks while retaining original text for audit.
- **Documentation Suite**: Added `docs/ORCHESTRATION.md`, `docs/MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`, and deployment optimization notes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical
- Deterministic prompt templates for progressive summarization ensure reproducible compression and auditability.
- Context assembly now performs deduplication & priority ordering (facts > summaries > short-term turns) with iterative token pruning.
- Registry-driven routing decouples model selection logic from application code (hot reconfig potential).

### üß™ Quality / Reliability
- Fallback invocation verified under forced failure scenarios.
- Token budget trimming tests enforce safe degradation instead of abrupt truncation.
- Memory deduplication prevents redundant fact & summary inflation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Follow-Ups
- Pluggable semantic intent classifier (embedding similarity) to augment rule set.
- Cost & latency adaptive dynamic weight tuning (feedback loop).
- Persistent metrics exporter & finalized Grafana dashboard JSON.
- Admin API hardening (API key / RBAC, rate limiting) & audit event stream.
- Advanced summarization validation (consistency / divergence detection).

### ‚ú® Added
- **First-Time Onboarding Animation**: Full-screen "KuroIntro" branded animation shown only once per authenticated user after initial sign-in.
- **Backend Persistence for Intro State**: New Mongo-backed `intro_shown` flag stored in `users` collection with REST endpoints:
	- `GET /user/{user_id}/intro-shown` ‚Üí `{ intro_shown: bool }`
	- `POST /user/{user_id}/intro-shown` (body: `{ "shown": true }`) to mark as displayed (idempotent).
- **Skip / Auto-Dismiss Controls**: User can dismiss the intro early via a Skip button; auto-dismiss occurs after ~7s.
- **Personalized Welcome Phrases**: Intro cycle now greets user by first name when available.
- **Extensible Intro Component**: `KuroIntro` now accepts `phrases`, `cycleMs`, `fullscreen`, and `onFinish` callback.
- **Session Title UX Improvements**: Manual title editing, generate button, and debounce-based auto-naming suppression after manual edits.
- **Enhanced Markdown & Code Block UX**: Copy single block & full-response, syntax highlighting, safety-aware rendering.
- **Mobile Chat Polishing**: Persistent keyboard focus, tighter spacing, adaptive sidebar behavior, responsive layout refinements.
- **System & Rate Limit Messaging**: Styled system messages with type classification (rate_limit, error, warning, normal).

### üîÑ Changed
- Landing page no longer embeds the intro animation; onboarding moved to post-auth flow for cleaner marketing landing.
- Chat initialization flow now concurrently checks name setup and intro flag without blocking chat availability.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical
- Added persistence helpers `get_intro_shown`, `set_intro_shown` in `memory/user_profile.py`.
- Added new endpoints in `chatbot.py` for intro state management.
- Frontend API layer (`src/lib/api.ts`) extended with `getIntroShown` & `setIntroShown` helpers and graceful fallback to `localStorage` if backend unavailable.
- `Chat.tsx` integrates intro overlay via `AnimatePresence` with fade transitions.

### üß™ Quality / Reliability
- Added failsafes ensuring loading / typing indicators reset if stuck.
- Idempotent intro persistence prevents duplicate writes on refresh.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Follow-Ups (Not Included in 1.1.0)
- Replay intro from a user settings panel.
- Telemetry around onboarding completion.
- Progressive enhancement: reduced-motion variant for accessibility.
- Multi-tenant customization (theming / phrase injection per org).
