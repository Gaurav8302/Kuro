# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Commitment to Security

Kuro AI takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and the measures we've implemented to protect users and their data.

## üîí Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Clerk Integration** - Enterprise-grade authentication service
- **JWT Token Validation** - Secure session management
- **Protected Routes** - API endpoint access control
- **User Session Management** - Secure login/logout flows

### Data Protection
- **Environment Variable Security** - API keys never exposed in code
- **Input Validation** - All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Output Sanitization** - AI responses cleaned before display
- **CORS Protection** - Proper cross-origin resource sharing configuration

### AI Safety & Content Filtering
- **Multi-layered Safety System** - Content filtering and validation
- **Hallucination Detection** - Prevents AI from generating false information
- **Harmful Content Blocking** - Blocks inappropriate or dangerous responses
- **Response Quality Scoring** - Ensures helpful, appropriate responses

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement** - All communications encrypted in transit
- **Secure Headers** - Security headers for web protection
- **Rate Limiting** - Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Error Handling** - Secure error messages without information leakage

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures

### Environment & Secrets Management
- [x] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [x] `.env.example` created with placeholder values
- [x] No hardcoded API keys or secrets in code
- [x] Environment variables used for all sensitive configuration

### API Security
- [x] CORS properly configured for allowed origins
- [x] Security headers added (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [x] Proper error handling without exposing internal details
- [x] HTTP exception handling with appropriate logging
- [x] Debug mode disabled in production (`DEBUG=false`)

### Code Quality
- [x] Comprehensive logging with proper formatting
- [x] Input validation using Pydantic models
- [x] Proper exception handling throughout
- [x] No duplicate endpoints
- [x] Clean separation of concerns

### AI Safety System
- [x] Content filtering for harmful responses
- [x] Hallucination detection mechanisms
- [x] Response quality validation
- [x] Safety guardrails in prompt system

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** Create Public Issues
- Do not open GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Do not discuss security issues in public forums or social media

### 2. **Contact Us Privately**
- **Email**: security@kuro-ai.com
- **Subject**: Security Vulnerability Report - [Brief Description]
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours

### 3. **Provide Detailed Information**
Include the following in your report:
- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** and severity assessment
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

## üîí Production Deployment Checklist

When deploying to production, ensure:

### Environment Security
- [ ] Set `DEBUG=false`
- [ ] Use production database URLs
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domain only
- [ ] Enable HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Use strong, unique API keys
- [ ] Set secure environment variables

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS everywhere
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Set up proper backup procedures
- [ ] Use environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Enable security headers
- [ ] Configure firewall rules

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Set up application monitoring
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Set up health check monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerting for errors
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection

## üîß Security Configuration Examples

### Environment Variables
Never include sensitive information in your code:

```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER do this
const API_KEY = "sk_test_abc123def456";

# ‚úÖ Always do this
const API_KEY = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY;
```

### CORS Configuration
```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[os.getenv("FRONTEND_URL")],  # Specific origin only
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST"],  # Specific methods only
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### Input Validation
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class ChatMessage(BaseModel):
    message: str
    session_id: str
    
    @validator('message')
    def validate_message(cls, v):
        if len(v) > 2000:
            raise ValueError('Message too long')
        return v.strip()
```

## üö® Never Commit These Files
- `.env` (contains real API keys)
- Any files with actual credentials or secrets
- Private keys or certificates
- Database dumps with real data
- Configuration files with production secrets

## ‚úÖ Safe to Commit
- `.env.example` (with placeholder values only)
- All source code files
- Configuration files without secrets
- Documentation and README files
- Public configuration templates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **AI Response Validation** - While we have safety filters, AI responses should always be used with caution
2. **Rate Limiting** - Current rate limiting is basic; consider implementing more sophisticated protection for high-traffic scenarios
3. **Data Retention** - Review data retention policies based on your privacy requirements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Advanced Rate Limiting** - IP-based and user-based rate limiting
2. **Enhanced Monitoring** - Security event logging and alerting
3. **Regular Security Audits** - Automated security scanning
4. **Penetration Testing** - Regular third-party security assessments
