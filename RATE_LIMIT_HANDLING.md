# Rate Limit Handling Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides graceful rate limit handling for Kuro AI when using the Groq API. Users receive user-friendly messages when rate limits are encountered, and can retry their requests easily.

## Features

### 🎯 **Enhanced Error Detection**
- Detects specific Groq API error types (429, 401, 403, 5xx)
- Categorizes errors into user-friendly types
- Provides specific retry information when available

### 🎨 **System Message Display**
- Custom `SystemMessage` component for rate limit notifications
- Color-coded message types (amber for rate limits, red for errors, etc.)
- Retry buttons for rate limit messages
- Markdown-style formatting support

### 🔄 **Smart Retry Mechanism**
- Stores last failed message for easy retry
- One-click retry from system messages
- Prevents message loss during rate limit periods

## Error Types Handled

### Rate Limit (429)
```
⏰ **Rate Limit Reached**
I'm temporarily paused due to API rate limits. Retry after X seconds.
🔄 **What you can do:**
• Try again in a few minutes
• Browse your chat history
• Start new conversations (they'll be saved)
```

### Quota Exceeded (403)
```
📊 **Daily Quota Reached**
We've reached today's API usage limit for the Groq LLaMA 3 model.
🕒 **Reset Information:**
• Quota resets every 24 hours
• You can still browse previous chats
```

### Authentication Error (401)
```
🔐 **Service Configuration Issue**
There's a temporary authentication issue with our AI service.
👨‍💻 **We're on it:**
• This is a configuration issue on our end
• Service should be restored soon
```

### Server Error (5xx)
```
🔧 **AI Service Temporarily Down**
The AI service is experiencing technical difficulties.
🔄 **Please try:**
• Waiting a few minutes and trying again
• Starting a new conversation
```

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
1. **Enhanced Groq Client (`utils/groq_client.py`)**
   - Specific HTTP status code handling
   - Structured error messages with prefixes
   - Retry-after header parsing

2. **Improved Chat Manager (`memory/chat_manager.py`)**
   - Rate limit message generation
   - User-friendly error responses
   - Graceful degradation

### Frontend Changes
1. **New Components**
   - `SystemMessage.tsx` - Displays system notifications
   - Enhanced `ChatBubble.tsx` - Handles system messages

2. **Enhanced Chat Interface**
   - Rate limit message detection
   - Retry functionality
   - Message type categorization

### Message Flow
```
User Input → Chat Manager → Groq API
                ↓
          Rate Limit Error
                ↓
        System Message Generated
                ↓
        Displayed to User with Retry Option
```

## Usage Examples

### User Experience
1. User sends a message
2. If rate limit is hit, they see a friendly system message
3. User can click "Try Again" to retry the same message
4. System preserves the conversation context

### Developer Testing
```python
# Test rate limit handling
from memory.chat_manager import chat_manager
response = chat_manager.generate_ai_response("Hello", "Test context")
# Will return structured rate limit message if quota exceeded
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ Clear understanding of what happened
- ✅ Easy retry mechanism
- ✅ No lost messages
- ✅ Transparent communication

### For Developers
- ✅ Structured error handling
- ✅ Easy debugging with error codes
- ✅ Graceful degradation
- ✅ User retention during issues

## Configuration

The system automatically detects rate limit responses and converts them to system messages. No additional configuration required.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] API status monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Predictive rate limit warnings
- [ ] Queue system for rate-limited requests
- [ ] Usage analytics and quota tracking
